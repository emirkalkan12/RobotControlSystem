# RobotControlSystem
 Purpose of the Project

This project is designed to provide the control of an Omni-directional robot (capable of moving in all directions) and the management of sensor data. A software has been developed that facilitates the movement control of the robot in a simulator environment and the processing of environmental data. This project, carried out using the Webots simulator, aims to create a foundation for the development and management of robotic systems.

 Scope
The project covers areas such as motion control of the robot, safe navigation, data collection from sensors, mapping operations and the management of these operations. The robot is programmed through various classes and methods in order to be able to perform the given tasks. However, the software is limited to run only in the simulator environment. Features such as integration with external hardware and working in a real-world environment have been excluded from the scope of this project.

Technologies Used 
In the development of this project, the C++ programming language was used and object-oriented programming principles were used. The Webots simulator has been used as the main platform in the control and testing process of the robot. In addition, the classroom library named FestoRobotAPI is integrated into the project to perform the functions of the robot such as motion and sensor management. A modular structure was adopted during the software development process, and the design was supported with UML diagrams and test programs.
